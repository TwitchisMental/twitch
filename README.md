Just fork this project and then clone to your local. The projects docroot should be /public
Once you have the project cloned and your vhost setup then just open terminal in vscode
and type
composer install (you will need to have composer installed globally)
then you should be good to go. Replace the asset paths with whatever suites your needs.
